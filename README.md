# âœ¨ Stackbit Fjord Theme - Gatsby - Aleks2a Fork âœ¨


This is a [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.com) theme using Git as a CMS. It was created from [Stackbit Fjord Theme](https://github.com/stackbit-themes/fjord-gatsby).

I added some improvements from the original project :
* loading images with gatsby plugin to improve the page loading
* moving Google fonts to self hosted fonts, compliant with GDPR rules
* adding slideshows images
* using GastbyJS v4.6

However, with this improvements, contents are only editable from Markdown.
